From the rubric, the things I have not implemented are:
•When the player runs out of tiles they receive no feedback
    the tiles just stop coming
•The player must start from the left most slot and can only put
    tiles into the slot to the right of the that most recent slot
    they can be taken out in any order though
•It looks ugly
